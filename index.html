<h4>A short story by Green Guy</h4>
<hr>
<p>The sun arised once more, just as it always had in the sweet little town of Abracole. Time is an endless cycle, in which everyone is a slave to its schedule. Nathan was one of these people, and - not being nocturnal -  he woke up in the morning. It was the first step for getting ready for school.
<p>Nathan brushed his teeth, combed his hair, got dressed, gathered his things, and did everything he needded to before he left the house. Then, he left the house and caught a ride onto the local school bus. As usual, he sat in the seat in front of the second fire alarm on the right side, with his friend Pam.
<p>"Hey Pam!" Nathan exclaimed.
<p>"Hey Nathan," Pam replied. "Did you watch the new episode of Rock Shock yesterday?"
<p>"Oh shoot!" Nathan yelled. "I completely forgot! I never forget!"
<p>Pam laughed. "Don't worry, I won't spoil it for you." Nathan let out a <abbr title="with fries">sigh of relief.</abbr> "But there was this one part where-"
<p>"Nooo!" Nathan interupted. "I don't even want to know the little details! I want to watch it blind."
<p>"Then how are you gonna see the TV?" Nathan laughed at Pam's joke. Pam was usually the one who found every oppurtunity to make people laugh. You don't need to know that much about ice as long as you know how to break it.
<p>Shortly after, the bus had arrived at Dewpoint High, where all the kids got off of the school bus and went inside the school. Nathan and Pam walked into the cafeteria, got their breakfast, and sat where they usually sat - the table not next to the right most window but the table next to that one. There they sat down with more of their friends: Oliver and Umberto.
<p>"Hello fellow humans," Umberto announced.
<p>"Did you guys see the new episode of Rock Shock?" Oliver asked.
<p>"Nathan didn't!" Pam sings sort-of mockingly, but a joking kind of mockingly.
<p>"I meant to but I forgot!" Nathan explained. "I tried to remember but I feel asleep and got distracted by my cat."
<p>"Ha!" Pam yelled. "I guess your cat g-"
<p>"Pam, stop." Oliver commanded. "No cat jokes today."
<p>"I guess you could say-"
<p>"No Pam. You can't say it."
<p>There was an akward silence, but then the school bell rang so it was all over. Nathan left to go to his first block class, English 10 with Mr. DiBisceglie.
<p>"Good morning class," the teacher said. "Your writing topic is on the board, and after we finish that we'll start going over literary devices."
<p>Taylor, who sat next to Nathan, leaned over to him. "Did you watch the new episode of Rock Shock?" she whispered.
<p>"No," he replied, "I forgot. Don't spoil anything at all."
<p>"Not even the part where the-"
<p>"No, not even that part."
<p>Hours passed by. Nathan had already gone through half his classes, and now it was time for lunch. Umberto, Pam, and Sarah were there at their usual lunch table already.
<p>"I heard someone didn't watch Rock Shock last night!" Sarah states. "You should know by now that sleep is not that important."
<p>"Wh," Nathan questioned. "I need my sleep."
<p>Umberto, Pam, and Sarah laughed. It went on for too long, so Nathan counted how long they laughed. He got to twelve (12) seconds.
<p>"So how has your day been going, Nathan?" Umberto asked.
<p>"Terrible," he answered. "All I've been thinking about is how long it takes to get home so I can watch the episode. School is a lot longer today than one would usually think."
<p>"Well, that's the price you have to pay," explained Pam. "If you don't watch the new episodes, it lengthens time to make you suffer."
<p>Nathan stared in <abbr title="I guess you could say he stared in rock shock">shock</abbr>.
<p>Oliver and Taylor sat down at the lunch table.
<p>"Hello," Nathan greeted.
<p>"Aw dang," Oliver said. "If you didn't see the new episode, that means we can't have our weekly Wednesday chats!"
<p>All of Nathan's friends sighed in agreement.
<p>"We're all a slave to schedule," Sarah philosophied, "unless one of your friends is too busy with his cat."
<p>Pam leaned onto the table. "I guess you could say th-"
<p>"No, Pam," Sarah commanded. "No cat jokes."
<p>Pam leaned off the table.
<p>After another akward scilence, the bell rang and lunch was over. One more period to go, and the day is over.
<p>And that period happened, and it was over. Nathan went home on the school bus, sitting where he usually sat - the seat in front of the second fire alarm on the right side, with his friend Pam.
<p>"Can't this bus hurry up?" Nathan screamed.
<p>"It probably could, but it wouldn't be able to stop as easily."
<p>"It just needs to skip to my stop so I can watch this darn episode."
<p>"Nu, I want to get home, too!"
<p>"Okay, skip everyone's stop but mine and yours."
<p>Pam and Nathan laughed together until the bus stopped at Pam's apartments. Then, afterwards, the bus dropped Nathan off.
<p>Nathan ran into his house, and went into the living room.
<p>"You're awful quick today," Nathan's mom said.
<p>"I missed my show, but now I finally get to watch it!"
<p>"Understandable," his mom replied.
<p>Nathan quickly turned the cable to the "on demand" feature, and started to watch the new episode of Rock Shock.
<p>It was a good episode, but the story could've been a little coaler.
